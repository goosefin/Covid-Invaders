# Covid-Invaders

This is a modern take on the classic space invaders game from the 70's. Growing up I spent a lot of time in arcades and I wanted to recreate a small memory from my childhood with it's own twist. This is a two player game where each player plays as a syringe that is shooting down covid cells. I created this game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript as well as Canvas API. Hope you enjoy!

GOALS (user-stories):
- As a player I want to know which keys on the keyboard make the syringe move so I can play.
- As a player I want my syringe to be a different color than my opponents so I can keep track of it at all times.
- As a player I would want to know what my score is so that I know If Iâ€™m in the lead or not.
- As a player I want to know how much time is left on the clock so that I can try to kill more cells than my opponent.
- As a player I want to know who won once the timer is up.
- As a player I want to be able to replay the game once its over so that I can keep enjoying this really cool app that an incredibly smart, talented and hardworking developer created.

UPCOMING FEATURES:
- Power ups that allow users to shoot at the cells with multiple shots in different directions.
- Sound effect that starts when there is 10 seconds left to the game to notify players the round is coming to a close.
- High score board for return players.
- Cells that require multiple hits to take down.
